# Lecture Activity 2 - Instructions

In lecture activity 2, we will write our first java program and execute it from the Terminal, Geany, and Visual Studio Code

## Task 1: Learn to deal with a merge conflict

- Locally, add your name somewhere to the README.md file; then `add`, `commit`, and then `push` your changes to GitHub. 
- On GitHub.com, in your Lecture Activity 2 repo (this one), add a new line to the end of your README.md file, saying "The Toronto Raptors are going to win against the Indiana Pacers tonight." (or whatever other sentence you like)
- Locally, write another sentence at the end of your README.md file WITHOUT running a `git pull`. You can use the sentence "It is snowing in Kelowna tonight."
- Add the change to the README.md file locally, commit it, and then try to push it. The push will FAIL because you made a change on GitHub.com and didn't pull it down.
- Open the README.md file, and resolve the merge conflict manually by removing one of the two sentences (any one is fine)
- Add a commit that deals with the merge conflict.
- Push the changes

## Task 2: Write your first Java program

Starting with this template, create a new file in this repository called `main.java`.

Remember, to create a new file, first navigate to this directory locally using `cd path/to/this/repo` and then type: `code main.java`.
This will open a new file called `main.java` in Visual Studio Code. 
Then, copy and paste this boilerplate code:

```
public class main {

	public static void main(String[] args) {
	  // Enter the lines you want to print here
	}
  
}
```

Replace the line `// Enter the lines you want to print here` with a comment about the code you enter. 
Remember that Java does not compile or run any comments. 

In your small groups, write one line for each member of your group that includes their name, and a simple arithmetic expression involving addition, subtraction, multiplication, or division.
One line of output will be something like:

> The name of the first person in our group is Mariam and their favourite number is 42.

## Task 3: Run your program

Add at least two screenshots to this section showing that you ran the file in the Terminal (required), Geany OR Eclipse OR Visual Studio Code.

## Task 4: Update your README file 

Update your README file to include links to your Java file, add and reference the screenshots in your README.md file
